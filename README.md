# EC327 Software Engineering
## <ins>Course Description</ins>
This course aims to introduce students to software design, programming techniques, data structures, and software engineering principles. The course is 
structured bottom up, beginning with basic hardware followed by an understanding of machine language that controls the hardware and the assembly language 
that organizes that control. It then proceeds through fundamental elements of functional programming languages, using C as the case example, and continues 
with the principles of object-oriented programming, as principally embodied in C++ but also its daughter languages Java, C#, and objective C. The course 
will conclude with an introduction to elementary data structures and algorithmic analysis. Throughout, the course develops core competencies in software 
engineering, including programming style, optimization, debugging, compilation, and program management, utilizing a variety of Integrated Development 
Environments and operating systems.
