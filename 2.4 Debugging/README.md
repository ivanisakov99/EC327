### <ins>Problem: Debugging</ins>
1. Open the number_operations.cpp file and read the descriptions of each function - they tell you what the functions are supposed to do
2. Use GDB and commands we just went over to find and fix each of the bugs. â€‹Cheatsheet is your friend. This assignment may require extensive search in the web, feel free to play with GDB in simple programs.
3. Add comments on each line where you found a bug and how you fixed it. What GDB commands did you use to find it?
4. Compile malloc.cpp with the following command: a.) g++ -std=c++11 malloc.cpp -o malloc
5. In the malloc.cpp, look at the functions and try to find the problem.
    * Add comments to the lines where you find problems in malloc.cpp.
    * Is there any other tool that we can use for debugging? If there is, explain the tool briefly and write the command that you used.
