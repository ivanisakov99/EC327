### <ins>Problem 1: Fibonacci Sequence</ins>
Write a C++ program (Q1.cpp) that takes a positive integer N as input from the command line and prints on the screen the first N numbers in the
Fibonacci sequence, one per line. The program should check whether the provided input is a number and terminate with an error if is not. See the 
following sample runs for examples of the output that you need to provide.

*ext in < > in the examples demonstrates the user inputs entered via the keyboard. The actual user inputs should not contain < or > signs.*

    Sample run 1:
    Enter the length of the sequence: <6> 
    0
    1
    1
    2 
    3 
    5
    
    Sample run 2:
    Enter the length of the sequence: <0>
    
    Sample run 3:
    Enter the length of the sequence: <x> 
    Error! You did not provide a number.
    

### <ins>Problem 2: Simple Calculator</ins>
Write a C++ program (Q2.cpp) that takes simple, one operand arithmetic operations from the command line and calculates the result. The program should 
accept signed integers as operands, and support the *, /, +, - operators. When provided to the command line, operands and operators should be separated by a space, in the following way:
