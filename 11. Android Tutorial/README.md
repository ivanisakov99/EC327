### <ins>Problem: Android Tutorial</ins>
In this lab you will be given code for a functional tip calculator app. The most important files are:
* MainActivity.java 
* Result.java
* main.xml
* result.xml
* strings.xml

To pass, you must add a few features and correct a handful of problems:
* Correct the spelling errors (hint look at the strings.xml file).
* Add a new 5% button to the .xml document and add a click
listener for it.
* Reformat the .xml files to accommodate the new 5% button
above the 10% button.
